\section{Notes}

\subsection{What is the premise of our game?}

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
  \1 The player is in charge of preparing a city for nuclear war; the goal is to
  ensure the survival of as much of the population as possible.
  \1 Resources must be managed and relocated, infrastructure must be prepared,
  and the population must be prepared and controlled.
  \1 The player does not know exactly when the bombs will drop, but news
  bulletins will be delivered that indicate the likelihood of imminent war.
  \1 The player must balance preparation with civil unrest.
    \2 If the player institutes provocative measures without suitably
    dark news, the population may resist or become frightened.
    \2 Civil unrest significantly hinders the players ability to adequately prepare.
\end{outline}
